<h1>Welcome</h1>
 <p2>This organization shows the truth behind the skinwalkers who roam the earth. Many believe that they are fake or just a myth to tell kids to get scared, but they do exist and it's something we have to keep an eye out for. Skinwalkers are old creatures that were created by Navajo people (which is a Native American tribe from southwest United States) Which are said to be an evil spirit. Skinwalkers could be some sort of ghost, demon or Alien but It is pretty clear that they are witches who used to be human but sacrificed themselves or something else to become a shapeshifter. Skinwalkers can take many different forms like a human or animal, which makes it hard to tell if they are real or not, and it's important to know if they are a skinwalker before you start attacking them or running. Skinwalker hide and stay In certain places which Is why Humans don't see them often. It is important to know how to identify one and what to do when you find one.

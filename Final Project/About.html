<h1>About Us</h1>
 <p>This Organization was founded in 1985 by Eduardo Gutierres. Eduardo Gutierres was born in Southern texas but grew up and lived all his life in Arizona. In his twenties Eduardo worked as a cameraman for a news channel. One day when he was walking through the forest on a hike he came across a skinwalker in the distance. He took a picture and ran to his car. Later he went to the news station he worked at to get his picture on the news. He started to promote his new organization called “The skinwalker Awareness club” where he would learn new things about skin-walkers and hear people's skin-walker experiences and teach others about them.

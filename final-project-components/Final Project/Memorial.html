 <p>This memorial is to share the life and accomplishments of Eduardo Gutierres who died In 2013 wanting to learn more about these creatures so that he could help others. Eduardo had a wife and two kids who loved and supported him very much. Eduardo was found dead on the edge of a small forest in Arizona, It was unknown what killed him, he has had a history of having heart attacks so that's what they assumed it was. Now Eduardo's wife Susan helps run this organization so that she can do and teach everything her husband wanted to.

<p>Similar to Kate Wagner I also started using the internet to ask my questions. When I was around 7 years old my parents got me an ipad for christmas, I started using my ipad alot to search things up and watch youtube videos. When i was born technology and the internet was still new and was not as advanced, but it was in my household by my parents and older brother. As I grew older I started to learn more about the internet, specifically social media. I started getting apps like snapchat, instagram and twitter.
 </p>
<p>Kate Wagner talks about how her favorite/most popular social media back then was Myspace and facebook. She talks about how My Space was basically the best and how apps today are nothing like it because it was very colorful and creative because you were able to design your page however you wanted. As a Gen Z i could never relate to those things because I never had My Space and it wasn't a thing when I was exploring different social media platforms. In fact she said that facebook used to be the most popular platform and that all the young people would use it but now it is what all the older people use and is not as popular as instagram and tik tok. </p>

<p>In Kate's essay she talks about how she felt that My Space was given a title of “ghetto”, and that facebook was the better app because it was more organized and it's what all the kids used for their schools to create groups for tutoring or creating groups for jobs. Overall there was more of a purpose to Facebook than My Space because the only cool thing about My Space was that you could change your page to however you wanted. I feel like there are apps like that today where some are kind of useless/or have been called useless and aren't really needed. For example Snapchat, It used to be very popular but now it is not as used. On the other hand apps like tik tok are the most used because it can be for everyone and there are multiple purposes to it.
 </p>
<p> I don't want to sound like a typical kid from this generation that is obsessed with tik tok, But tik tok is one of my favorite social media platform that i have ever had, I have had it since the beginning before in gained all it popularity, tik tok used to be about kids being able to make silly and goofy videos and being open to be yourself but now it has evolved into a whole different thing. In a way I do miss how it used to be were people would sing and dance and paint, but at the same time i love the way tik tok is now, It has help so many people find jobs or even pay their rent, There's a whole shop that people can buy or sell from, and it is a very good news source. The thing that I love most about tik tok is that I can learn how to do anything there very fast, I have probably learned more things on tik tok then i have in middle school.
</p>
<p> Overall the internet has drastically changed in good ways and in bad ways, A.I. and Chat GPT is starting to become a huge trend and in my opinion we are advancing in technology but not in a good way because it is a threat to many people who might get their jobs taken away. Hopefully we learn from our mistakes and we use the internet for good.</p>

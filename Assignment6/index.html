<p>They are stories of shape-shifting creatures across Navajo Nation, the 24k-plus reservation land encompassing most of northeastern Arizona and the adjacent corner sections of New Mexico and Utah. Skinwalkers are to many believers a taboo subject and seldom discussed out loud. The Navajo Skinwalker legend is not unlike that of the European werewolf: A once-ordinary human discovers the ability to shift into animal form. Unlike the werewolf, however, the Skinwalker curse is desired and acquired, that is, Skinwalkers do not have the bad luck to be “bitten” and forced into the curse. Rather, they want it and are willing to perform extraordinary rites of evil in order to achieve it.

<p>SkinWalkers are creature's who do witchcraft in the sounthern states of the United States of America. The stories were created by the Navajo tribe and became part of there culture. These skinwalkers are witches who used to be human and wanted/asked to be a shapeshifter to do evil things. Like said by Adam, they are able to shift into any animal form. They are not forced into becomeing a shapeshifter, they have to choose to become one by doing a sacrafice. Skinwalkers live in the southern states like Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and texas. This is around where the Navajo tribe use to live which is why they discoverd it and became part of their culture.

    This organization shows the truth behind the skinwalkers who roam the earth. Many believe that they are fake or just a myth to tell kids to get scared, but they do exist and it's something we have to keep an eye out for. Skinwalkers are old creatures that were created by Navajo people (which is a Native American tribe from southwest United States) Which are said to be an evil spirit. Skinwalkers could be some sort of ghost, demon or Alien but It is pretty clear that they are witches who used to be human but sacrificed themselves or something else to become a shapeshifter. Skinwalkers can take many different forms like a human or animal, which makes it hard to tell if they are real or not, and it's important to know if they are a skinwalker before you start attacking them or running. Skinwalker hide and stay In certain places which Is why Humans don't see them often. It is important to know how to identify one and what to do when you find one.

    This Organization was founded in 1985 by Eduardo Gutierres. Eduardo Gutierres was born in Southern texas but grew up and lived all his life in Arizona. In his twenties Eduardo worked as a cameraman for a news channel. One day when he was walking through the forest on a hike he came across a skinwalker in the distance. He took a picture and ran to his car. Later he went to the news station he worked at to get his picture on the news. He started to promote his new organization called “The skinwalker Awareness club” where he would learn new things about skinwalkers and hear people's skinwalker experiences and teach others about them. By 1996 the organization grew a lot and became very popular in the southern states. The organization began to study skinwalkers more seriously to learn how to avoid them and what to do when encountering one. Now over 4,000 people have joined this organization to learn more about these paranormal creatures.
